# Storage of String Literals
The characters of a literal string are stored in order at contiguous memory locations. An escape sequence (such as **\\\\** or **\\"**) within a string literal counts as a single character. A null character (represented by the **\0** escape sequence) is automatically appended to, and marks the end of, each string literal. (This occurs during [translation phase](../c/phases-of-translation.md) 7.) Note that the compiler may not store two identical strings at two different addresses. [/GF](../buildref/-gf--eliminate-duplicate-strings-.md) forces the compiler to place a single copy of identical strings into the executable file.  
  
## Remarks  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Strings have static storage duration. See [Storage Classes](../c/c-storage-classes.md) for information about storage duration.
